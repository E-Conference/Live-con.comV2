As a reaction on the numerous requests coming from the tremendously increasing user community of LarKC, we set up a demonstration package for LarKC that is intended to present the main subsystems, development tools and graphical user interfaces of LarKC. The demo aims for both early adopters and experienced users and serves the purpose of promoting Semantic Web Reasoning and LarKC technologies to the potentially new user communities.","addTopic":[25,26,27],"addAuthor":[25]},{"setTitle":"Did you validate your ontology?

These constraints are not tractable without automatic reasoning. But the configuration process, which helps a customer to make her choice, one step at a time, is a traversal of a graph of partially defined products - that is, Linked Data. This natural yet fruitful abstraction for product customization results in a generic configuration API, in use at Renault, who has begun publishing data about its range in this way. Current achievements and prototypes of forthcoming developments are presented.","addTopic":[50,51,52,53,54],"addAuthor":[143,176]},{"setTitle":"Karma: A System for Mapping Structured Sources into the Semantic Web","setAbstract":"The Linked Data cloud contains large amounts of RDF generated from databases. Much of this RDF, generated using tools such as D2R, is expressed in terms of vocabularies automatically derived from the schema of the original database. The generated RDF would be significantly more useful if it was expressed in terms of commonly used vocabularies. Defining the mapping from structured sources such as databases or spreadsheets to ontologies is labor intensive using today’s tools. For example, to define such mappings in R2R, users must write a mapping rule for each column, and each mapping is expressed in terms of graph patterns, which are hard to write. In this work, we present a semi-automatic approach for building mappings from structured sources to ontologies.

From the technical point of view, the system is tuned to discover reliable data in the web and to process these data in order to convert them into knowledge, which is stored in a dedicated repository.

The work described in this paper aims at reporting a migration from a static HTML website to a semantic wiki in the medical domain.

The approach presented in this paper utilizes visualization techniques for offering visual feedback about the reasons the results were retrieved. It represents the semantic neighborhood of search results, the relations between results and query terms as well as the relevance of search results and the semantic interpretation of query terms for fostering search result comprehension. It also provides visual feedback for query enhancement. Therefore, not only the search results are visualized but also further information that occurs during the search processing is used to improve the visual presentation and to offer more transparency in search result generation. The results of an evaluation in a real application scenario show that the presented approach considerably supports users in assessment and decision-making tasks and alleviates information seeking in digital semantic knowledge bases.","addTopic":[64,65,66,67,68],"addAuthor":[98,135,287,363]},{"setTitle":"Evaluating scientific hypotheses using the SPARQL Inferencing Notation","setAbstract":"Integrating experimental data and claims from the literature with hypotheses is an essential activity for the life scientist.

HyQue uses domain-specific rule sets to evaluate hypotheses based on well understood scientific principles. However, because scientists may use differing scientific premises when exploring a hypothesis, flexibility is required in both crafting and executing rule sets to evaluate hypotheses. Here, we report on an extension of HyQue that incorporates rules specified using the SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN). Hypotheses, background knowledge, queries, results and now rule sets are represented and executed using Semantic Web technologies, enabling users to explicitly trace a hypothesis to its evaluation, including the data and rules used by HyQue.

The logics-based representation emphasizes the meaning of concepts and properties, i.e., their semantics. The modeler in the object-oriented paradigm also takes into account the pragmatics, i.e., how the classes are used, by whom, and why. To enable a comprehensive use of logics-based representations in object-oriented software systems, a seamless integration of the two paradigms is needed. However, the pragmatic issues of using logic-based knowledge in object oriented software applications has yet not been considered sufficiently. Rather, the pragmatic issues that arise in using an ontology, e.g., which classes to instantiate in which order, remains a task to be carefully considered by the application developer. In this paper, we present a declarative representation for designing and applying programming access to ontologies. Based on this declarative representation, we have build OntoMDE, a model-driven engineering toolkit that we have applied to several example ontologies. These ontologies have been selected in order to showcase the benefits of the our approach and the OntoMDE toolkit over a range of different ontology characteristics in terms of complexity, level of abstraction, degree of formalization, provenance, and domain-specificity.","addTopic":[71,72,73],"addAuthor":[53,493,501]},{"setTitle":"Clinical Trial and Disease Search With Ad Hoc Interactive Ontology Alignments","setAbstract":"We will explain how an Linked Open Drug Data (LODD) application based on diseases, drugs, and clinical trials can be used to improve the (ontology-based) clinical reporting process while, at the same time, improving the patient follow-up treatment process.

The concrete application for query relaxation involves matching (possibly vague) descriptions of entities involved in crimes to structured descriptions thereof in the database. Here, the core research questions are: (i) how can we formalise potentially vague structured queries in a generic manner; (ii) how can we support approximate, structured query-answering over RDF? We first discuss the use-case, formalise the problem, and survey current literature for possible approaches.  Next, we present a proof-of-concept framework for enabling relaxation of structured entity-lookup queries, evaluating different distance measures for performing relaxation. We argue that, beyond our specific use-case, query relaxation is important to many potential use-cases for Semantic Web techniques, and worthy of further attention.","addTopic":[79,80,81],"addAuthor":[5,114,182,324]},{"setTitle":"Learning Driver Preferences of POIs using a Semantic Web Knowledge System","setAbstract":"In this paper, we present the architecture and implementation of a Semantic Web Knowledge System that is employed to learn driver preferences for Points of Interest (POIs) using a content based approach.

At a future time, when the driver searches for places that he/she might want to go to, his/her learnt model is used to personalize the result. The data that is used to learn preferences is represented as Linked Data with the help of a POI ontology, and retrieved from multiple POI search services by `lifting' it into RDF. This structured data is then combined with driver context and fed into a machine learning algorithm that produces a statistical model of the driver's preferences. This data and model is hosted in the cloud and is accessible via intelligent services and an access control mechanism to a client device like an in-vehicle navigation system.

It generally requires formulating multiple queries, browsing many pages of results and assessing the returned ontologies against each other to obtain a relevant and adequate subset of ontologies for the intended use. Our hypothesis is that part of the difficulty related to searching ontologies comes from the lack of structure in the search results, where ontologies that are implicitly related to each other are presented as disconnected and shown on different result pages. In a previous work, to overcome this situation, we devised a software framework, Kannel, that detects and makes explicit relationships between ontologies in large ontology repositories. In this paper, we present a study that compares the use of the Watson ontology search engine with the use of its extension, Watson+Kannel, that provides explicit information regarding the various types of relationships between the result ontologies. We evaluate the benefit of Watson+Kannel by measuring through various indicators how these explicit relationships between ontologies are used to improve the user’s efficiency in ontology search, thus validating our hypothesis.","addTopic":[184,185,186,187],"addAuthor":[84,152,359]},{"setTitle":"Graph Kernels for RDF data","setAbstract":"The increasing availability of structured data in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format poses new challenges and opportunities for data mining. Existing approaches to mining RDF have focused on one specific data representation, one specific machine learning algorithm or one specific task, only. Kernels, however, promise a more flexible approach by providing a powerful framework for decoupling the data representation from the learning task. This paper focuses on how the well established family of kernel-based machine learning algorithms can be readily applied to instances represented as RDF graphs. We first review the problems that arise when conventional graph kernels are used for RDF graphs. We then introduce two versatile families of RDF graph kernels based on intersection graphs and intersection trees. These kernels can better exploit the inherent properties of RDF, while providing an easy to use interface between any RDF graph (including vocabulary extensions such as RDFS and OWL) and any kernel-based learning algorithm (which are available for solving many machine learning tasks). The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated on two common relational learning tasks: entity classification and link prediction. The results show that our novel RDF graph kernels with standard SVMs achieve competitive predictive performance when compared to specialized techniques for both tasks.","addTopic":[188,189,190,191],"addAuthor":[1,502,541]},{"setTitle":"Enhancing OLAP Analysis with Web Cubes","setAbstract":"Traditional  On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools have proven to be successful in analyzing large sets of enterprise data.

Analyses were then conducted included investigation of the use of SKOS constructs; the use of SKOS semantic relations and lexical labels; and the structure of vocabularies in terms of the hierarchical and associative relations, branching factors and the depth of the vocabularies. Even though SKOS concepts are considered to be the core of SKOS vocabularies, our findings were that not all SKOS vocabularies published explicitly declared SKOS concepts in  the vocabularies.  Almost one-third of the SKOS vocabularies collected fall into the category of \"term lists\", with no use of any SKOS semantic relations. As concept labelling is core to SKOS vocabularies a surprising find is that not all SKOS vocabularies use SKOS lexical labels, whether '{skos:prefLabel' or 'skos:altLabel', for their concepts. The branching factors and maximum depth of the vocabularies have no direct relationship to the size of the vocabularies. We also observed some common modelling slips found in SKOS vocabularies. The survey is useful when considering, for example, converting artefacts such as OWL ontologies into SKOS, where a definition of typicality of SKOS vocabularies could be used to guide the conversion.   Moreover, the survey results can serve to provide a better understanding of the modelling styles of the SKOS vocabularies published on the Web, especially when considering the creation of applications that utilizes these vocabularies.","addTopic":[196,128,129,197,130],"addAuthor":[399,455,469]},{"setTitle":"Characterising Emergent Semantics in Twitter Lists","setAbstract":"Twitter lists constitute a form of organising Twitter users into sets, and can be created and maintained by any user in Twitter.

As such, many popular classes of web applications, from product categorization, similar-product comparative pricing, localized services, to vertical or enterprise search, utilize them. However, their manual generation and maintenance by experts is a time-costly and cumbersome procedure, often resulting in platform-dependent and static vocabularies. Hence lots of research has been focusing currently on more flexible and dynamic methods to develop them, as evidenced for example by the huge interest of folksonomies within the social media realm.  We propose a new approach for constructing taxonomies. Our idea stems from the increased human involvement and desire to provide tags and annotate web content (e.g., in social media and product categorization applications). We define the required input from human users in the form of explicit structural information; that is, supertype-subtype relationships between concepts. Humans have a good understanding of such relationships. In this way, we harvest, via common annotation practices, the collective wisdom of users with respect to the (categorization of) web content they share and access. We further define the principles upon which crowdsourced taxonomy construction algorithms should be based. We show that the resulting problem is NP-Hard. We provide heuristic algorithms and relevant optimizations that  aggregate human input, resolving conflicting input, and produce taxonomies. Our algorithm's evaluation is based on real-world crowdsourcing experiments (where real users provide such information) and on real-world taxonomies.","addTopic":[204,14,205,206,207],"addAuthor":[133,427]},{"setTitle":"The ISOcat Registry Reloaded","setAbstract":"The linguistics community is building a metadata-based infrastructure for the description of its research data and tools.

Descriptors have definitions in natural language and little explicit interrelations. With the registry growing to many hundred entries, authored by many, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the rather informal definitions and their glossary-like design make it hard for users to grasp, exploit and manage the registry's content. In this paper, we take a large subset of the ISOcat term set and reconstruct from it a tree structure following the footsteps of schema.org. Our ontological re-engineering yields a representation that gives users a hierarchical view of linguistic, metadata-related terminology. The new representation adds to the precision of all definitions by making explicit information which is only implicitly given in the ISOcat registry.  It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set. The new representation can serve as a complement to the existing ISOcat model, providing additional support for authors and users in browsing, (re-)using, maintaining, and further extending the community's terminological metadata repertoire.","addTopic":[208,209,210,211,212],"addAuthor":[99,110,524]},{"setTitle":"Exploiting  Information Extraction,  Reasoning and Machine Learning for Relation Prediction","setAbstract":"The three most common approaches for deriving or predicting   instantiated  relations, i.e.  triple  statements (s, p, o), are information extraction, reasoning and relational machine learning.

These data models are defined as specializations of directed acyclic (hyper)graphs, and it is claimed that every kind of linguistic annotation can be represented as a directed (hyper)graph (Bird and Liberman 2001).  Linguistic corpora can thus be naturally linearized in RDF. Unlike earlier approaches to model generic data models for linguistic annotations by means of Semantic Web standards (e.g., Cassidy 2010), POWLA augments the RDF linearization of linguistic data with a data model formalized in an OWL/DL ontology that defines data types for primary data, annotations and linguistic metadata, as well as consistency constraints on linguistic corpora. Unlike other approaches to model linguistic corpora in OWL/DL (e.g., Burchardt et al. 2008), POWLA is not specific to a particular type of annotation, but it implements a generic data model. This genericity is illustrated here for the conversion of GrAF (the XML linearization of the Linguistic Annotation Format, Ide and Suderman 2007) to POWLA. That POWLA preserves the linguistic information conveyed in the original GrAF data as shown by an experient to emulate ANNIS-QL, a query language specifically designed for heterogeneous and richly annotated linguistic corpora (Chiarcos et al. 2008), by means of SPARQL macros on POWLA data.

This approach automatically generates a mapping from the data source into the ontology, but since the precise mapping is sometimes ambiguous, we allow the user to interactively refine the mappings. We implemented this approach in a system called Karma, and demonstrate that the system can map sources into an ontology with minimal user interaction and efficiently generate the corresponding RDF.","addTopic":[55,22,283,57],"addAuthor":[33,113,270,297,336,384,410,423,479]},{"setTitle":"LODifier: Generating Linked Data from Unstructured Text","setAbstract":"The automated extraction of information from text and its transformation into a formal description is an important goal of in both Semantic Web research and computational linguistics. The extracted information can be used for a variety of tasks such as ontology generation, question answering and information retrieval. LODifier is an approach that combines deep semantic analysis with named entity recognition, word-sense disambiguation and controlled Semantic Web vocabularies in order to extract named entities and relations between them from text and to convert them into an RDF representation which is linked to DBpedia and WordNet. We present the architecture of our tool and discuss design decisions made. Evaluations of the tool give clear evidence of its potential for tasks like information extraction and computing document similarity.","addTopic":[284,51,285,286,191,287],"addAuthor":[233,471,472]},{"setTitle":"Automatic Identification of Best Answers in Online Enquiry Communities","setAbstract":"Online communities are prime sources of information. The Web is rich with forums and Question Answering (Q&A) communities where people go to seek answers to all kinds of questions. Most systems employ manual answer-rating procedures to encourage people to provide quality answers and to help users locate the best answers in a given thread. However, in the datasets we collected from three online communities, we found that half their threads lacked best answer markings. This stresses the need for methods to assess the quality of available answers to: 1) provide automated ratings to fill in for, or support, manu- ally assigned ones, and; 2) to assist users when browsing such answers by filtering in potential best answers. In this paper, we collected data from three online communities and converted it to RDF based on the SIOC ontology. We then explored an approach for predicting best answers us- ing a combination of content, user, and thread features. We show how the influence of such features on predicting best answers differs across communities. Further we demonstrate how certain features unique to some of our community systems can boost predictability of best answers.","addTopic":[288,289,290,291],"addAuthor":[197,214,568]},{"setTitle":"A publishing pipeline for Linked Government Data","setAbstract":"We tackle the problem of high cost associated with generating Linked Government Data (LGD). Our approach is centered around the idea of \"self-service LGD\".  The self-service approach is enabled through an end-to-end publishing pipeline that enables transforming raw government data into interlinked RDF. The cost reduction involved is achieved through: (i) shifting the burden of Linked Data conversion towards the data consumer (ii) integrating all the steps involved into a single workbench (iii) providing graphical user interfaces (iv) enabling result sharing with sufficient provenance information. We present the implementation of the publishing pipeline and describe its application to a local government catalogue in Ireland resulting in a significant amount of Linked Data published.","addTopic":[292,293,51,294,295],"addAuthor":[162,452,545]},{"setTitle":"Unsupervised Learning of Data Linking Configuration","setAbstract":"As commonly accepted identifiers for data instances in semantic datasets (such as ISBN codes or DOI identifiers) are often not available, discovering links between overlapping datasets on the Web is generally realised through the use of fuzzy similarity measures. Configuring such measures, i.e. deciding which similarity function to apply to which data properties with which parameters, is often a non-trivial task that depends on the domain, ontological schemas, and formatting conventions in data. Existing solutions either rely on the user's knowledge of the data and the domain or on the use of machine learning to discover these parameters based on training data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to tackle the issue of data linking which relies on the unsupervised discovery of the required similarity parameters. Instead of using labeled training data, the method takes into account several desired properties which the distribution of output similarity values should satisfy. The method includes these features into a fitness criterion used in a genetic algorithm to establish similarity parameters that maximise the quality of the resulting linkset according to the considered properties. We show in experiments using benchmarks as well as real-world datasets that such an unsupervised method can reach the same levels of performance as manually engineered methods, and how the different parameters of the genetic algorithm and the fitness criterion affect the results for different datasets.","addTopic":[296,297,298],"addAuthor":[48,152,359]},{"setTitle":"Domain Specific Data Retrieval on the Semantic Web","setAbstract":"The Web content no longer consists of only general text documents, but increasingly structure domain specific data published in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. Data collections in this cloud are, by definition, from dif- ferent domains and indexed with domain specific ontologies and schemas. Such data representation requires retrieval methods that can operate on structured data and semantic feature spaces and remain effective even for small domain specific collections. Unlike previous research, that has concentrated on extending text search by using ontologies as a source for query expansion, we introduce a re- trieval framework based on the well known vector space model of information retrieval to fully support retrieval for Semantic Web data described in Resource Description Framework (RDF) language. We propose an indexing structure, a ranking method, and a way to incorporate reasoning and query expansion in the framework. We evaluate the approach in ad-hoc search using a cultural heritage data collection. Compared to a baseline, experimental results show up to 77% improvement when a combination of reasoning and query expansion is used.","addTopic":[299,300,93,301,302],"addAuthor":[535]}],"organizations":[{"setName":"A2ZI"},{"setName":"Aalto University and University of Helsinki"},{"setName":"Advanced Technologies Application Center, CENATAV"},{"setName":"Alcatel Lucent Bell Labs"},{"setName":"Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs France"},{"setName":"American Psychological Association"},{"setName":"Amsterdam Museum"},{"setName":"ArcelorMittal Asturias"},{"setName":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"},{"setName":"Arizona State University"},{"setName":"Aston University"},{"setName":"Athabasca University"},{"setName":"BBC"},{"setName":"BBN Technologies"},{"setName":"Bell Labs Research"},{"setName":"Birkbeck, University of London"},{"setName":"Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics"},{"setName":"Bundeswehr University Munich, Germany"},{"setName":"Carleton University"},{"setName":"Centre for Next Generation Localisation & Knowledge and Data Engineering Group at Trinity College Dublin"},{"setName":"CERN TH-Division, PH-TH, Geneva 23"},{"setName":"Clark & Parsia LLC"},{"setName":"ISTC-CNR"},{"setName":"CNR-ISTI"},{"setName":"Cognitive Interaction Technology, Center of Excellence"},{"setName":"Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia"},{"setName":"Complex Networks and Systems Group, Institute for Scientific Interchange (ISI) Foundation"},{"setName":"Computer Science Department.

Defining the mapping from structured sources such as databases or spreadsheets to ontologies is labor intensive using today’s tools.

Our system, Karma, automatically derives these mappings, and provides an easy to use interface that enables users to control the automated process to guide the system to produce the desired mappings.

The modeler in the object-oriented paradigm also takes into account the pragmatics, i.e., how the classes are used, by whom, and why. To enable a comprehensive use of logics-based representations in object-oriented software systems, a seamless integration of the two paradigms is needed. However, the pragmatic issues of using logic-based knowledge in object oriented software applications has yet not been considered sufficiently. Rather, the pragmatic issues that arise in using an ontology, e.g., which classes to instantiate in which order, remains a task to be carefully considered by the application developer.

The concrete application for query relaxation involves matching (possibly vague) descriptions of entities involved in crimes to structured descriptions thereof in the database.

We first discuss the use-case, formalise the problem, and survey current literature for possible approaches.

Therefore, an increasingly perceived need for Semantic Web (SW)  applications is the representation of the context of such knowledge and  its formalization for using it in reasoning and querying. Recognizing  this problem, several extensions of RDF and OWL to support contextual  qualification of knowledge have been proposed. Among these, we recently  presented the Contextualized Knowledge Repository (CKR), a framework  with a well-founded semantics based on established AI principia for  contextual representation and reasoning.

Our hypothesis is that part of the difficulty related to searching ontologies comes from the lack of structure in the search results, where ontologies that are implicitly related to each other are presented as disconnected and shown on different result pages. In a previous work, to overcome this situation, we devised a software framework, Kannel, that detects and makes explicit relationships between ontologies in large ontology repositories. In this paper, we present a study that compares the use of the Watson ontology search engine with the use of its extension, Watson+Kannel, that provides explicit information regarding the various types of relationships between the result ontologies.

Existing approaches to mining RDF have focused on one specific data representation, one specific machine learning algorithm or one specific task, only. Kernels, however, promise a more flexible approach by providing a powerful framework for decoupling the data representation from the learning task. This paper focuses on how the well established family of kernel-based machine learning algorithms can be readily applied to instances represented as RDF graphs. We first review the problems that arise when conventional graph kernels are used for RDF graphs. We then introduce two versatile families of RDF graph kernels based on intersection graphs and intersection trees.

Hence lots of research has been focusing currently on more flexible and dynamic methods to develop them, as evidenced for example by the huge interest of folksonomies within the social media realm.  We propose a new approach for constructing taxonomies. Our idea stems from the increased human involvement and desire to provide tags and annotate web content (e.g., in social media and product categorization applications). We define the required input from human users in the form of explicit structural information; that is, supertype-subtype relationships between concepts. Humans have a good understanding of such relationships. In this way, we harvest, via common annotation practices, the collective wisdom of users with respect to the (categorization of) web content they share and access. We further define the principles upon which crowdsourced taxonomy construction algorithms should be based. We show that the resulting problem is NP-Hard.

These data models are defined as specializations of directed acyclic (hyper)graphs, and it is claimed that every kind of linguistic annotation can be represented as a directed (hyper)graph (Bird and Liberman 2001).  Linguistic corpora can thus be naturally linearized in RDF. Unlike earlier approaches to model generic data models for linguistic annotations by means of Semantic Web standards (e.g., Cassidy 2010), POWLA augments the RDF linearization of linguistic data with a data model formalized in an OWL/DL ontology that defines data types for primary data, annotations and linguistic metadata, as well as consistency constraints on linguistic corpora. Unlike other approaches to model linguistic corpora in OWL/DL (e.g., Burchardt et al. 2008), POWLA is not specific to a particular type of annotation, but it implements a generic data model. This genericity is illustrated here for the conversion of GrAF (the XML linearization of the Linguistic Annotation Format, Ide and Suderman 2007) to POWLA.

In those settings, a structural index groups nodes in a graph based on some equivalence criterion, for example, indistinguishability with respect to some query workload (usually XPath).

Existing solutions either rely on the user's knowledge of the data and the domain or on the use of machine learning to discover these parameters based on training data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to tackle the issue of data linking which relies on the unsupervised discovery of the required similarity parameters. Instead of using labeled training data, the method takes into account several desired properties which the distribution of output similarity values should satisfy. The method includes these features into a fitness criterion used in a genetic algorithm to establish similarity parameters that maximise the quality of the resulting linkset according to the considered properties. We show in experiments using benchmarks as well as real-world datasets that such an unsupervised method can reach the same levels of performance as manually engineered methods, and how the different parameters of the genetic algorithm and the fitness criterion affect the results for different datasets.";i:3;N;i:4;N;i:5;N;i:6;s:51:"unsupervised-learning-of-data-linking-configuration";i:7;i:1;}s:5:"types";a:7:{i:1;i:2;i:2;i:2;i:3;i:2;i:4;i:2;i:5;i:2;i:6;i:2;i:7;i:1;}s:11:"executionMS";d:0.00017309188842773438;s:11:"explainable";b:1;}i:810;a:5:{s:3:"sql";s:114:"INSERT INTO paper (title, abstract, url, publisher, publishDate, slug, conference_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";s:6:"params";a:7:{i:1;s:50:"Domain Specific Data Retrieval on the Semantic Web";i:2;s:1158:"The Web content no longer consists of only general text documents, but increasingly structure domain specific data published in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. Data collections in this cloud are, by definition, from dif- ferent domains and indexed with domain specific ontologies and schemas. Such data representation requires retrieval methods that can operate on structured data and semantic feature spaces and remain effective even for small domain specific collections. Unlike previous research, that has concentrated on extending text search by using ontologies as a source for query expansion, we introduce a re- trieval framework based on the well known vector space model of information retrieval to fully support retrieval for Semantic Web data described in Resource Description Framework (RDF) language. We propose an indexing structure, a ranking method, and a way to incorporate reasoning and query expansion in the framework. We evaluate the approach in ad-hoc search using a cultural heritage data collection. Compared to a baseline, experimental results show up to 77% improvement when a combination of reasoning and query expansion is used.";i:3;N;i:4;N;i:5;N;i:6;s:50:"domain-specific-data-retrieval-on-the-semantic-web";i:7;i:1;}s:5:"types";a:7:{i:1;i:2;i:2;i:2;i:3;i:2;i:4;i:2;i:5;i:2;i:6;i:2;i:7;i:1;}s:11:"executionMS";d:0.00016093254089355469;s:11:"explainable";b:1;}i:811;a:5:{s:3:"sql";s:183:"INSERT
